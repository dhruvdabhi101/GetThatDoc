Problem it Solves :
- Today compnies which provide study material only target one or two branches.
- Also There is no Application/Webiste where Study Material of every branch and every stream is available.
- So we have come up with the Idea of GetThatDoc where Every Student of Every Branch can Upload and Download notes any time.
